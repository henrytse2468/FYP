*** if the service will stop working after several hours *************
Systems user services by default only run as long as there is at least 
one session active for the user. When a user logs out from the last (or only) 
session, the systemd --user instance for that user is killed. 
You can change this by enabling lingering of systemd user instances. 
This is done per user using the following command: loginctl enable-linger *username*. 
When lingering is enabled, the user services are started at boot, and continue to run
even if there is no active session for the user.
